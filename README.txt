Installing the application:

The application is a portable JAR file, so installing java is the only necessary step.

Java 25 is required, which can be found here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk25


Running the application:

Once java is installed, double clicking the application should be enough to launch it.  

If this does not work, instead run the application from the command line using java -jar

If the application still does not run, check your system's PATH and JAVA_HOME environment variables to ensure that the correct version of java is listed.

No files are created during the application's runtime, so it does not matter where the JAR is ran from.
